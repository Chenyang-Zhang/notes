# 18.Determinants 

Up to now we paid a lot of attention to rectangular matrices. 

Now, concentrating on square matrices. Determinants and Eigen values are big, big chunk of 18.06.

<h2 id="fc7bcc02eaa53ccf05c2b3f48461de47"></h2>

## Determinants , det A = |A| 

Every square matrix has a number associated with , called its determinant. 

- det A = 0 , means A is singular.  
- det A !=0 , means A is invertible.

<h2 id="71fed0c3428bf1a2e19af257c4bac379"></h2>

## Properties 

3 base properties:

1. det I = 1.
2. Exchanging rows reverse sign of det.  
3. The determinant depends linearly on **one** row. (single row linearity)
    - 3a: Add vectors in a row
        - 
        ```
        |a+a' b+b'| =|a b| + |a' b'|
        |c    d   |  |c d|   |c  d |
        ```
    
    - 3b: Multiply by t in row

## Formula for detA ( n! terms )

 - use property 3 to break down each row 
    - [a b c] = [a 0 0] + [0 b 0] + [0 0 c]
 - the determinant of A can be expanded into n‚Åø terms 
 - a lot terms has 0 det,  they can be removed.
 - The nonzero terms have to come in different columns and rows.

## Cofactor formula

Cofactor is a way of breaking up above big formula that connects the nxn determinant to a determinant one smaller. 

![](../imgs/LA_det_cofactor_filter.png)

- **The determinant of A is a combination of any row i times its cofactors**.
    - **det A by cofactors:** det A = a·µ¢‚ÇÅC·µ¢‚ÇÅ + a·µ¢‚ÇÇC·µ¢‚ÇÇ + ... + a·µ¢<sub>ùëõ</sub>C·µ¢<sub>ùëõ</sub>. (10)
    - The cofactor is the determinant of M·µ¢‚±º , with the correct sign:
        - **delete row i and column j:** C·µ¢‚±º = (-1)‚Å±‚Å∫ ≤ detM·µ¢‚±º.   (11)

## Cramers Rule for x=A‚Åª¬πb

![](../imgs/la_1806_cramer_rule.gif)

What do I get in C·µÄb ? What's the first entry of C·µÄb ?  

Somehow I multiply cofactors by the entries of b, anytime I'm multiplying cofactors by numbers, I think, I'm getting the determinant of something. Let's call the matrix B , whose determinant comes out of C·µÄb .

So x‚ÇÅ = detB‚ÇÅ/detA  , x‚ÇÇ = detB‚ÇÇ/detA , ... 

**4C:** Cramer's rule: The jth component of x = A‚Åª¬πb is the ratio

![](../imgs/LA_det_cramer_rule.png)

Actually, Cramer's Rule is a disastrous way to go, because compute these determinants takes like approximately forever.  

But having a formula allows you to do algebra instead of algorithms. They're nice formulas, but I just don't want you to use them.

# 21. EigenValues - EigenVectors 

There are certain vectors where Ax comes out parallel to x. And those are the eigenvectors.  **Ax=Œªx**.

If A is singular, Œª=0 is an eigenvalue.

Now the question is how do we find these x-s and Œª.

<details>
<summary>
Projection Matrix
</summary>

Any x in projection plane  Ax=x , Œª=1

Any x ‚üÇ plane,  Ax=0 , Œª=0.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
Permutation Matrix
</summary>

```
A =

   0   1
   1   0
```

x = [1;1] , Œª=1

x = [-1;1] , Œª=-1. In fact, the trace tells you right away what the other eigenvalue is.

</details>

How to solve Ax=Œªx ?

(A-IŒª)x = 0.    A-IŒª has to be singular.


<h2 id="9e08a229f7feafd17be0f57fed7d544d"></h2>

-----

## det[A-ŒªI] = 0 

The idea will be to find Œª first. I'll find n Œª's.  A Œª could be repeated, A repeated Œª is source of all trouble in 18.06.

<h2 id="95946abeb88b298e53a6c970166fb7aa"></h2>

-----

## Trace = Œª‚ÇÅ+Œª‚ÇÇ+ ... + Œª<sub>n</sub>

Fact: sum of Œª's = a‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ+a‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ+ ... + a<sub>nn</sub>.


<details>
<summary>
Symmetric Matrix Example 
</summary>

```
A =
   3   1
   1   3


det(A-ŒªI) = |3-Œª 1| = (3-Œª)¬≤-1
            |1 3-Œª|

          = Œª¬≤-6Œª+8 
```

This example is great. 6 is the trace ,and 8 is the determinant. 

Œª‚ÇÅ=4, Œª‚ÇÇ=2 . 

```
A-4I = 
  -1   1
   1  -1
```

x‚ÇÅ= [1;1]

```
A-2I = 
   1   1
   1   1
```

x‚ÇÇ= [-1;1]

</details>

What's the relateion between the Permutation example and Symmetric example ?

Simple but useful observation: if I add *n*¬∑I to a matrix, its eigenvectors don't change, and its eigen values are *n* bigger.


<details>
<summary>
Why does it happen ? 
</summary>

Suppose I have a matrix A, and Ax=Œªx. I add 3I to that matrix. 

(A+3I)x = Œªx + 3x = (Œª+3)x

</details>


<details>
<summary>
Rotation matrix Q
</summary>

```
Q = 
   0  -1
   1   0
```

90¬∞ rotation.

trace = 0 = Œª‚ÇÅ+Œª‚ÇÇ , det = 1 = Œª‚ÇÅŒª‚ÇÇ.  Œª¬≤=-1.

What I'm leading up to with this example is that something is gonna go wrong, because what vector can come out parallel to itself after a 90¬∞ rotation? 

Œª‚ÇÅ=i, Œª‚ÇÇ=-i. 

</details>

If a matrix was symmetric, it wouldn't happen ( complex number Œª ). So if we stick to matrices that are symmetric , or close to symmetri, then the eigenvalues will stay real. But if we move far away from symmetric , for this example it's anti-symmetric , the bad thing will happen. 


<details>
<summary>
Here's one more bad thing that could happen.
</summary>

```
A =
   3   1
   0   3
```

This is a triangular matrix.  It's really useful to know you can read the eigenvalues off, they're  right on the diagonal. 

Œª‚ÇÅ = Œª‚ÇÇ = 3. 

```
(A-ŒªI)x = |0 1|x = 0
          |0 0|
```

x‚ÇÅ=[1;0]  , x‚ÇÇ= NO 2nd independent x 

This is a degenerate matrix. It's only got one line of eigenvectors instead of two.  It's this possibility of a repeated eigenvalue opens this further possiblity of a shortage of eigenvectors.

## Diagonalizing a matrix 


<details>
<summary>
S‚Åª¬πAS = Œõ
</summary>

Suppose we have n independent eigenvectors of A , put them in columns of S.  
S is the eigenvector matrix. 

```
     ‚é° |  |      |  ‚é§   ‚é° |    |        |   ‚é§
AS = ‚é¢ x‚ÇÅ x‚ÇÇ ... xn ‚é• = ‚é¢Œª‚ÇÅx‚ÇÅ Œª‚ÇÇx‚ÇÇ ... Œªnxn ‚é•.
     ‚é¢ |  |      |  ‚é•   ‚é¢ |    |        |   ‚é•
     ‚é£ |  |      |  ‚é¶   ‚é£ |    |        |   ‚é¶
```

Each time A multiply eigenvectors , the eigen value comes out.

```
     ‚é°  |   |        |  ‚é§   ‚é°  | |      |  ‚é§ ‚é°Œª‚ÇÅ       ‚é§
AS = ‚é¢Œª‚ÇÅx‚ÇÅ Œª‚ÇÇx‚ÇÇ ... Œªnxn‚é• = ‚é¢ x‚ÇÅ x‚ÇÇ ... xn ‚é• ‚é¢  Œª‚ÇÇ     ‚é•.
     ‚é¢  |   |        |  ‚é•   ‚é¢  | |      |  ‚é• ‚é¢    ...  ‚é•
     ‚é£  |   |        |  ‚é¶   ‚é£  | |      |  ‚é¶ ‚é£       Œªn‚é¶
```

If I want a number to multiply x,  then I can do it by puting x·µ¢ in column i (I get S back again), and multiply by a diagonal matrix. 

**AS = SŒõ**. 

Provided my assumption of n independent eigenvectors,  I multiply S‚Åª¬π on the left , I got 

**S‚Åª¬πAS=Œõ**.

if I multiply  S‚Åª¬π on the right , I got 

**A=SŒõS‚Åª¬π**.

## Powers of A / equation u<sub>k+1</sub> = Au<sub>k</sub>

<details>
<summary>
Can I just begin to use that ? For example how about A¬≤ ? What's eigenvectors and eigenvalues of A¬≤ ? 
</summary>

If Ax = Œªx 

A¬≤x = ŒªAx = Œª¬≤x. 

So the eigenvalues of A¬≤ are Œª¬≤, and the eigenvector is the same x as A.

This is one way to do it . 

Now let me see that also from formula A=SŒõS‚Åª¬π.

A¬≤x = SŒõS‚Åª¬π¬∑SŒõS‚Åª¬πx = SŒõ¬≤S‚Åª¬π. It's telling me the same thing that I just learned here, but in a matrix form. It's telling me that the S is the same, the eigenvectors are the same; but the eigenvalues are squared.

</details>

A·µè = SŒõ·µèS‚Åª¬π . 

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors give a great way to understand the powers of a matrix. 

Theorem: A·µè‚Üí0 as k‚Üí‚àû  if all |Œª·µ¢|<1 .  

So far I'm operationg on one assumption: I had a full set of n independent eigenvectors. If we don't have n independent eigenvectors can not diagonalize the matrix,  S‚Åª¬π can not make sense.

**A is sure to have n independent eigenvectors (and be diagonalizable) if all the Œª's are different (no repeated Œª)**. 

If I have repeated Œª's , I may or may not have n independent eigenvectors (think about the Identity matrix).

This is my unknown. 

So I'm going to get a 2x2 system, first order, instead of a scalar system, second order:

![](../imgs/la_1806_fib_system.png)

This is my system. 

And what's my one step equation? 

![](../imgs/la_1806_fib_equation.png)

What's the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix ?  

Œª‚ÇÅ = -0.61803, Œª‚ÇÇ = 1.61803 . 

How fast are those Fibonacci numbers increasing ? What's controlling the growth of these Fibonacci numbers? It's the eigenvalues. 

And which eigenvalue is controlling that growth? The big one. 

Since u‚ÇÄ = [1;0] , c‚ÇÅx‚ÇÅ+c‚ÇÇx‚ÇÇ = [1;0].

F‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÄ ‚âà c‚ÇÅ¬∑(1.61803)¬π‚Å∞‚Å∞.   ( the other terms involves c‚ÇÇ is ignored since it is very slow. )

    2. eigenvalue is allowed to be 0 ( i.e. projection matrix )
    3. sum of Œª's  equals the trace of matrix,  
    4. product of Œª's equals determinant of matrix. 
    5. singular matrix must have 0 Œª.  
        - number of 0 Œª's = dimension of null space.
    6. repeated Œª **MAY or may NOT** result in missing eigenvectors
    7. eigenvalue could be complex number.
        - Symmetric matrix's eigenvalues are all real. 
 - eigenvector 
    1. Eigenvectors of sysmmetric matrix are orthogonal.  (doesn's all eigenvectors orthogonal )
    2. A matrix may have no eigenvectors.  ( ? any example ? )

# 23. 

This section is about how to solve a system of first order, first derivative, constant coefficient linear equations. And if we do it right, it turns directly into linear algebra. The key idea is the sulutions to contant coefficient linear equations are **exponentials**.  

And the result, one thing we will find it's completely parallel to powers of a matrix.

## Differential Equations  du/dt=Au

<details>
<summary>
Example 
</summary>

u(0) = [1;0]

du‚ÇÅ/dt = -u‚ÇÅ+2u‚ÇÇ

du‚ÇÇ/dt =  u‚ÇÅ-2u‚ÇÇ

-> A = ‚é° -1  2 ‚é§
       ‚é£  1 -2 ‚é¶

So it starts u at time 0, everything starts at u‚ÇÅ. And as time goes on, du‚ÇÇ/dt weill be positive because of that u‚ÇÅ term, so flow will move into the u‚ÇÇ component and it will go out of the u‚ÇÅ component. 

So we'll just follow that movement as time goes forward by looking at the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of that matrix.
