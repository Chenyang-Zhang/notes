### Skating Introduction 

Coasting is what makes skating so fun.  Coasting is also an example of one of the most fundamental principles in all of physics, the principle of **inertia** : An object at rest tends to remain at rest,  and an object in motion tends to remain in motion.

### Why Does a Motionless Skater Tend to Remain Motionless?

Answer: An object at rest tends to remain at rest.  This behavior is known as inertia. (抽桌布实验)

割草机割草，即便一个竖直的草没有草根，因为惯性, 割草机也能切断它。

### Why Does a Moving Skater Tend to Continue Moving?

Answer: An object in motion tends to remain in motion.

We're ready for a formal statement of the concept or principle of inertia. It's known as Newton's First Law of motion: An object that is free of external forces  moves at a constant velocity (velocity is a vector).

Skating is full of examples of Newton's First Law.

### How Does a Skater Start, Stop, or Turn?

Answer: A force acts on the skater and causes the skater to accelerate.
